Passo a Passoy
Time Management:
    There is 72 hours to achive the goal. Me, the Executor,  has only 24 hours i the day
    which 8 are destined to sleeping, 2 for general activities and 9 to work. This means I have only 5 hours a day to apply to the project. 

    The Deadline for the conclusio is: 19:00 hours of may, 7 th of 2021.
    Human Resources: 5 hours per day, this is: 15:00 hours of me.
    Tools: Personal Notebok and open source libraries.

    Within only 15 hours of project and in a 3 days time basis the project shall be conducted within the Minimum Vaiable Product model, doing the essentially necessary and wraping everything in the most dry way, so the final client (reviewer) shall run and receive what was required. Somethings will fall short to a deployable infrastructute but nevertheless it should proove that the proposed model generate good results. 

    First 5 hours: Planning, Data Exploration And Data Cleaning.
        Should explore, view and clean the current.
    Second 5 hours: Feature Engineering and Model Aplication
        Should create new features to better serve Machine Learning Models, Apply at least 3 models to the project. 
    Last 5 Hours: Model Avaliation and Presentation:
        At the final sprint of the project the focus shall be on the evalutation of the model and on the presentation. As this project shall be reviewd by someone who understands python the main effort will be applied to leep it dry and comment anything necessary but a presentation should be added if there is time for it.

Data Cleaning:
    As in any Data Science Project, most of the time usually is and should be
    applied to the data cleaning step.
